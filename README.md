# Steps:
Key Features:

Data Collection and Organization: The Excel tool streamlines the process of gathering financial data, key ratios, and relevant metrics from both the target coffee company and its selected comparable companies. The data is organized in a structured format for easy analysis.
Valuation Multiples Calculation: The analysis calculates essential valuation multiples, including Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E), Price-to-Sales ratio (P/S), Price-to-Book ratio (P/B), and more. These multiples serve as the basis for comparing the target company's valuation against its peers.
Implied Value Per Share: The Excel tool calculates the Implied Value Per Share range for the target company based on the valuation multiples of the comparable companies. This range offers a preliminary estimate of the target company's fair value in relation to its industry peers.
1. Data Collection and Organization: Gathering financial data, key ratios, and relevant metrics from both the target coffee company and its selected comparable companies.
2. Valuation Multiples Calculation:<br/>
   *Price to Earnings ratio (P/E): Share price divided by earnings per share OR market capitalization divided by net income <br/>
   *EV/Revenue: Enterprise value divided by revenue <br/>
   *EV/EBITDA: Enterprise Value divided by Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) <br/>
3. Implied Value Per Share: The Excel tool calculates the Implied Value Per Share range for the target company based on the valuation multiples of the comparable companies.
