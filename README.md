# Steps:

1. Data Collection and Organization: Gathering financial data, key ratios, and relevant metrics from both the target coffee company and its selected comparable companies.
2. Valuation Multiples Calculation:<br/>
   *Price to Earnings ratio (P/E): Share price divided by earnings per share OR market capitalization divided by net income <br/>
   *EV/Revenue: Enterprise value divided by revenue <br/>
   *EV/EBITDA: Enterprise Value divided by Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) <br/>
3. Implied Value Per Share: calculates the Implied Value Per Share range for the target company based on the valuation multiples of the comparable companies.
